            <h2>Lodging</h2>
            Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive hostel to one large, four-star resort.
            There are many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed and breakfasts. All types of lodging
            are strictly regulated and regularly inspected by the Tanitian government.

            <h2>Grocery Stores</h2>
            <u>Taniti has five grocery stores in total</u>: two supermarkets, two smaller grocery stores, and one
            convenience store that is open 24 hours a day.

            <h2>Transportation</h2>
            Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow
            Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and
            propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on
            the island within the next few years.

            <h2>Ground Transportation</h2>
            <u>Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day.</u> Private buses serve the rest
            of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency
            near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by
            law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton
            Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
